## About
Suroi is an open-source 2D battle royale game inspired by [surviv.io](https://survivio.fandom.com/wiki/Surviv.io_Wiki). It is currently a work in progress.

## Play the game!
[suroi.io](https://suroi.io)

## Join the Discord!
[discord.suroi.io](https://discord.suroi.io)

## Installation and setup
Start by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

Next, [click here to download the repo](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), or use the following command to clone it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi.git
```

To install dependencies, open a terminal in the project root, and run this command:
```sh
pnpm install
```

This will create a `node_modules` directory in all three folders (`client`, `common`, and `server`) and link the packages there.

## Development
To run the game locally, open a terminal in the project root and run the following:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
To open the game, go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

## Production
To build for production, run this command in the project root:
```sh
pnpm build
```

To start the WebSocket server, run this command:
```sh
pnpm start
```

Production builds are served using [NGINX](https://nginx.org). A sample configuration file can be found [here](nginx.conf).
